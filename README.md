# AudioVisualizer
An audio visualizer assignment.

YouTube audio is of poor quality due to system hardware.

## Version Control
GitHub was not used for version control of this project, this was due to restriction from Unity as the Collaboration setting was on as to create this project as part of a team.

## What it does
The audio visualizer, when starting off will instantiate an array of 512 cubes in a 360° circle,
The camera will rotate around an empty GameObject located in the middle of the circle as to show off the different areas of the audio visualizer during the playing of a song giving the impression of a rolling effect of the audio.
For the input of the audio visualizer, I implemented that the audio can be paused – I also implemented volume controls so as to give the user the option of muting the audio entirely or increase and decrease by 10%

## Controls
W and Up Arrow will increase the volume until 100% and no more.
S and Down Arrow will decrease the volume until fully muted.
Spacebar will pause the audio, pressing Spacebar again will resume the audio.

## How to make it run
Loading the audio visualizer can be done through either the Unity editor, with the appropriate files associated or through a build created to run the audio visualizer, simply by opening the executable file.

## List of aspects of the project which made me proud

* Visuals fit extraordinarily well with the chosen genre – Inspired by “Trap Nation” styled visualizers.
* Positive feedback from showcasing the visualizer
* Adapted to feedback given to me, making it more of what people wanted to see from it.
* Using Unity for the project – Learning aspects of the engine and utilizing them within the visualizer.
* Hierarchy is tidy – someone could look at the hierarchy and see what is going on, without code knowledge.
* Kept within my scope of having a clean and sleek looking project without having features creep in during development.
* Code, to my knowledge is clean and tidy – I could improve by commenting my code.
* I believe the coding is done well since C# is new to me and chose to challenge myself
* Project management is clean – everything is sorted by folders or subfolders and is easily accessible.
* Project overall is user friendly without too much complexity for the end-user.
* All changes made when the visualizer is running for example, changing the volume of the audio or pausing it entirely is all displayed for the user to see what is happening.
